# ToyLanguage-Intepreter
The implementation of a ( java inspired) toy language interpreter that can run anything form basic allocation statements to complex loops and fork statements and semaphores. Since it does not include a parser for the toy language, the user has a graphical interface that allows them to select which program to run and then watch the execution step by step.
